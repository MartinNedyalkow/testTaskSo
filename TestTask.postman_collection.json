If human existence holds no significance, what can keep us from suicide? As Camus argues, if there is no God to give meaning to our lives, humans must take on that purpose themselves. This is our 'absurd' task, like Sisyphus forever rolling his rock up a hill, as the inevitability of death constantly overshadows us. Written during the bleakest days of the Second World War, The Myth of Sisyphus (Le Mythe de Sisyphe) argues for an acceptance of reality that encompasses revolt, passion and, above all, liberty. \",\r\n  \"img\":\"https://d1w7fb2mkkr3kw.cloudfront.net/assets/images/book/lrg/9780/1411/9780141182001.jpg\",\r\n  \"isBookmarked\":false,\r\n  \"dateOfCreation\":\"2017-08-01\",\r\n  \"dateOfLastUpdate\":\"2017-08-01\"\r\n}"
